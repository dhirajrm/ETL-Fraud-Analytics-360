# ETL Fraud Analytics 360

Welcome to the Fraud Analytics 360 Data Transformation and Loading Pipeline repository!

This project is designed to help you efficiently transform, load, and manage your data through a fully automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. Whether you're working with structured data like CSV files or dealing with complex transformations like JSON or API extracted data, this pipeline ensures your data is processed and loaded seamlessly into an SQLite database.

üöÄ Features

Dynamic Transformations: The pipeline supports both generic transformations (like handling null values, converting data types) and custom transformations tailored to specific datasets, allowing for easy scalability and flexibility.
Configuration Management: Feed-specific parameters like file paths and database configurations are managed through INI files, making it easy to modify and scale the solution for different environments.
Modular Design: With a clear separation between data transformation and data loading, the pipeline is both extendable and maintainable. You can easily add new transformations or modify the loading process without disrupting other components.

Error Handling & Logging: Built-in logging and error handling ensure that every stage of the ETL process is tracked and any issues are promptly identified and reported.
SQLite Integration: The pipeline loads processed data into an SQLite database, creating tables as needed and handling data inserts efficiently.

üí° How it Works

Extract: Data is loaded from source files (CSV, etc.) into the pipeline.
Transform: The data undergoes transformations such as type conversion, handling missing values, and any other custom transformations defined in separate Python scripts.
Load: The transformed data is then loaded into an SQLite database, where tables are created based on the data structure.
The pipeline also allows for modular extension: if you need to apply specific transformations or load data into a different database, you can easily adjust the configuration and scripts.

‚ö° Getting Started

To get started with the pipeline, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

bash

git clone hhttps://github.com/dhirajrm/ETL-Fraud-Analytics-360.git
cd data-transformation-pipeline
Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure your feed parameters: Update the INI files to specify your feed parameters like file paths and staging zones.

Run the pipeline:

To execute the transformation and load the data, run the following:
bash
python main.py


üîß Built With
Python: The main language used for scripting the ETL process.
Pandas: For handling and transforming the data.
SQLite: For loading the transformed data into a lightweight database.
ConfigParser: To manage configuration settings in an easily readable format.
üìÑ Example
For an example of how your data will flow through the pipeline, see the example data files in the repository. The pipeline handles files like users_data.csv and cards_data.csv, performing a range of transformations and loading the results into the SQLite database.

ü§ù Contributions
We welcome contributions! If you‚Äôd like to improve the pipeline, add new features, or fix bugs, feel free to fork the repo and submit a pull request. Please ensure to follow the coding style and include tests for any new functionality.
